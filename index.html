                <h1>What is the problem?</h1>
                <h3>The borders of the European Union are becoming testbeds for invasive new technology</h3>

                <h2>Why it matters?</h2>
                <p>Facial recognition, voice recognition iris scanning and predictive decision-making are used to mark
                    individuals as "risky", deny them access and take away their freedoms. The testing of these invasive
                    technologies at borders normalizes the algorithmic othering and discrimination of people on the
                    move. Under the premise of public safety, similar technologies and practices spread through our
                    cities and towns, too.</p>
                <h2>The Future we want</h2>
                <p>We want a future without these invasive and de-humanizing border technologies. Where companies making
                    it are regulated properly, and do not use refugees as guinea pigs for experimental technology.</p>

                <p>Although started in Berlin, we hope this project could be replicated across Europe, since it is open-source, and cheap to produce.</p>
                <p>We want it to live as a toolkit for others to bring Argus's WiFi into their cities.</p>
                <p>So that more people can stumble upon, and take action against, the dangers of invasive militaro-industrial border technologies.</p>
